# AI-Powered Portfolio Chatbot

A personalized, conversational AI chatbot that acts as a digital twin, answering questions about my professional profile, skills, and projects. This project uses a Django backend to connect with large language models and a vanilla JavaScript frontend for the user interface.

## Local Setup and Installation

To run this project on your local machine, you will need to set up the backend and frontend separately.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Git

### Cloning

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/girish2513/ai-portfolio-fullstack.git](https://github.com/girish2513/ai-portfolio-fullstack.git)
    cd ai-portfolio-fullstack
    ```

### Backend Setup

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Mac, use `venv\bin\activate`
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of the backend project folder.
    * Add your secret API keys to this file. This file is ignored by Git and should not be committed.
        ```
        # .env file
        OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
        GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key_here"
        DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="your_django_secret_key_here" 
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The backend will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Update the API URL:**
    * Open the `script.js` file.
    * Find the `apiUrl` constant and make sure it points to your local backend server for development:
        ```javascript
        const apiUrl = '[http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/chat/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/chat/)';
        ```

2.  **Run the frontend:**
    * There is no build step required for the vanilla JS frontend. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. Using a tool like the VS Code "Live Server" extension is recommended.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on **Vercel**. The `main` branch of each repository (frontend and backend) is automatically deployed to production. Environment variables for production are configured in the Vercel project settings.
